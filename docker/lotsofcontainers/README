This is a script to build out personalized Dockerfiles for use with
docker-compose.  Originally written for DevOpsDaycamp https://devopsbootcamp.osuosl.org/daycamp/
the idea is that you have a base image, the Dockerfile, that you would like to
customize for n different people.  In this case we just want different usernames,
passwords, and ports designated for individual HTTP and SSH access.

The Dockerfile declares the set of packages and there is an array inside 
makecontainers.py which declares the usernames.
